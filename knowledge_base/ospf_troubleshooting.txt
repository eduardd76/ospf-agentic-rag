# OSPF Troubleshooting Guide - Expert Edition

## 1. MTU Mismatch

**Symptoms:**
- OSPF neighbors stuck in EXSTART/EXCHANGE state.
- Log message: `%OSPF-5-ADJCHG: from EXCHANGE to EXSTART, Seq Number Mismatch`.

**Causes:**
- Mismatched MTU between adjacent interfaces.
- Tunnel overhead not accounted for.
- Misconfigured subinterfaces.

**Solutions:**
1. Check MTU: `show interfaces <int>`
2. Align MTU across interfaces or use `ip ospf mtu-ignore`
3. Avoid mtu-ignore in production; better to align physical settings.

## 2. Authentication Mismatch

**Symptoms:**
- Neighbors stuck in INIT or 2-WAY state.
- Log: `OSPF-4-AUTHFAIL`.

**Causes:**
- Different authentication types (null, simple, MD5).
- Incorrect keys or key IDs.

**Solutions:**
1. Match `ip ospf authentication` and keys on both sides.
2. Use MD5 for better security.
3. Debug with: `debug ip ospf adj` and `debug ip ospf packet`.

## 3. Hello/Dead Timer Mismatch

**Symptoms:**
- Neighbors not forming adjacency.
- Log: `OSPF: mismatched hello parameters`.

**Causes:**
- Hello/Dead interval mismatch.
- Manual config or interface type differences.

**Solutions:**
1. Check: `show ip ospf interface <int>`
2. Align hello/dead timers: `ip ospf hello-interval X` and `ip ospf dead-interval Y`

---

## 4. Network Type Mismatch

**Symptoms:**
- Neighbors stuck in 2-WAY or never form full adjacency.

**Causes:**
- One side configured as broadcast, other as point-to-point or NBMA.

**Solutions:**
1. Check: `show ip ospf interface`
2. Set consistent network types: `ip ospf network <type>`

---

## 5. OSPF Area Type Mismatch

**Symptoms:**
- Routes not exchanged between routers in the same area.

**Causes:**
- One router is in a stub area, the other is not.
- Improper ABR configuration.

**Solutions:**
1. Use `show ip ospf` and `show ip ospf database`
2. Align area types and use `area <x> stub` consistently

---

## 6. Missing or Blocked Interfaces

**Symptoms:**
- OSPF not seeing neighbor.
- `show ip ospf neighbor` empty.

**Causes:**
- Passive interfaces
- ACLs blocking OSPF (protocol 89)
- Wrong IP subnet or mask

**Solutions:**
1. Check: `show run | section ospf`
2. Remove passive config or permit OSPF in ACLs
3. Ensure interfaces share same subnet

---

## 7. Router ID Conflicts

**Symptoms:**
- Instability or incorrect LSAs

**Causes:**
- Two routers have same router-id (manual config or loopbacks)

**Solutions:**
1. Check with: `show ip ospf`
2. Set unique ID using: `router-id <A.B.C.D>`

---

## Useful Commands

```
show ip ospf neighbor
show ip ospf interface <int>
debug ip ospf adj
debug ip ospf hello
debug ip ospf packet
```

---

## Best Practices

- Always align MTU and timers
- Use authentication in production
- Prefer loopback interfaces for stability
- Avoid `mtu-ignore` unless strictly required
- Use router-id manually for predictability
